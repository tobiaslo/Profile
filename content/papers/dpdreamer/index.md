##### Abstract:

Most robot systems are based on a single decision-making process. This process needs to balance time, energy, and accuracy in every situation. However, according to "dual process theory" from cognitive psychology, this is not how humans work. Depending on the situation, we have the ability to switch between two thinking methods, a fast system 1 (S1) and a slower system 2 (S2). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to a dual process architecture for robots and agents. Our method, called Dual Process Dreamer (DPDreamer), is a combination of a reinforcement learning policy network, a planning algorithm, and a learned world model. The world model allows the parts of DPDreamer to work together and create a more integrated system compared to previous proposals. DPDreamer was tested in a puzzle game called Sokoban, and by balancing the use of S1 and S2, DPDreamer managed a success rate similar to S2 while using S1 most of the time, showing a significant benefit of using a more adaptable system.
